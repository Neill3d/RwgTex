 FEATURES:
----------

  This tool helps to automate texture conversion from image to DDS files:

  - can take a directory or a file as input

  - automatically rescales images to nearest Power-Of-Two (as some hardware have troubles with compressed NPOT textures)
 
  - detects some special file types (normalmaps, heightmaps) and tries to use best looking compression and compressor for them

  - for textures with alpha channels it scans alpha to check if it can be represented with one bit (DXT1) or requires compression with gradiant alpha (DXT5

  - multiple threads to compress

  - can convert Darkplaces sprites

  - can read from ZIP archives

  - wide range of options to get it run with particlular engine/mod
 
  - can compress DXT4/DXT5

  - convert thousands of files by single click

  - saves a cache of files crc32 to check if they were modified (speeds up compression when run next time by only compressing files that was changed)

----------
 USAGE:
----------

1) rwgdds.exe <input_dir> <output_dir>

   Scan <input_dir> for tga, jpg, png, spr32 files and convert them to DDS to output dir.

   Also it will generate a filescrc.txt file holding crc32 sums for source files used to make DDS. So next time you will run RwgDDS with this output folder it will only convert files that was changed.

2) rwgdds.exe <path>

   If <path> is file, it will convert it and place in same folder. 
   If it's a directory, it will convert all files in it and place in dds/ subdirectory.

Trick: can drag&drop files and directories to .exe

 COMMANDLINE PARMS:
----------

 -w         : wait for key press once finished, 
              (also this behavior is forced when
              any key given to exe name)
 
 -f         : suppress any prints

 -mem       : show memory usage stats at end

 -threads X : manually sets the number of threads

 -cd X      : change to this dir once started

 -nomip     : do not generate any mipmaps

 -ati       : use ATI compressor instead of mixed mode

 -nv        : use Nvidia DXTlib instead of mixed mode

 -nocache   : dont read/write filescrc.txt

 -npot      : allow non-power-of-two texture dimensions

 Trick: can include commandline parms to exe name, so they become defaults. Example: rwgdds-ati-w.exe

----------
 KNOWN BUGS:
----------

 NVidia DXTlib compresses DXT1+alpha with worse quality that ATI Compressor because it limits DXT1+alpha to use 3 colors for palettes instead of 4 (forcing 4-color on nvDXTlib gives binary alpha that applies to whole 4x4 block, which is not useful at all).

 DDS file may be wrong if source image has alpha channel with all-black pixels.
