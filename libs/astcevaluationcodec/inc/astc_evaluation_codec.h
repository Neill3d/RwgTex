/* ASTC evaluation codec header for RwgTex
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/ 

// The ASTC codec is written with the assumption that a float threaded through
// the "if32" union will in fact be stored and reloaded as a 32-bit IEEE-754 single-precision
// float, stored with round-to-nearest rounding. This is always the case in an
// IEEE-754 compliant system, however not every system is actually IEEE-754 compliant
// in the first place. As such, we run a quick test to check that this is actually the case
// (e.g. gcc on 32-bit x86 will typically fail unless -msse2 -mfpmath=sse2 is specified).
